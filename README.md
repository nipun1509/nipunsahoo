### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Nipun Sahoo**, a curious and passionate computer science undergrad based in India.  
Iâ€™m on a journey to explore how technology, especially AI and web development, can be used to solve meaningful real-world problems.

Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python**, and how full-stack applications work.  
As someone interested in health-tech, Iâ€™ve contributed to an academic project called **HeartVision**, a coronary artery detection system that combines AI and medical imaging to assist in early heart disease diagnosis.

I'm fascinated by impactful ideas and love building projects that align with innovation in healthcare and society.  
Whether itâ€™s exploring a new tech stack, reading about AI breakthroughs, or sketching out app ideas â€” Iâ€™m always learning.

Outside of tech, I enjoy thinking about how science meets creativity. I occasionally write, sketch, and absorb all things related to design, psychology, and productivity.
